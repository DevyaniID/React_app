ðŸš€ My First React Project

This is my very first project built with React.js, where I explored the fundamentals of modern front-end development. Through this project, I learned how to create reusable components, manage state, and work with props to build an interactive user interface.

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack: React.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
ðŸ”¹ Key Learnings: Component-based architecture, JSX, hooks, and basic routing

The goal of this project is to strengthen my foundation in React and showcase my journey into front-end development. I will continue improving it as I learn more advanced concepts.
